  <p class="text-gray-800 text-base mb-4">Business bank ratings indicates the size of the loan your business has the ability to debt service.</p>
  <p class="text-gray-800 text-base mb-4">Your business bank account reflects how you manage your cash flow. Lenders want to know that your business cash flow is capable of handling the business debt and expenses on a consistent basis. Bank accounts with low average daily balances, or that show NSF returned checks, can get your business loan applications declined.</p>
  <p class="text-gray-800 text-base mb-4">Your "Bank Rating" is based on your average daily minimum balance over the last 3 months. Bank ratings cannot be created in less than 3 months and are what lenders use to determine your business's ability to debt service. Having a "Low 3" bank rating will indicate to a lender that at any point in the last 90 days your business had only $100 to $300 available to pay any debts. Therefore if you are seeking a loan that requires a $1,000 monthly payment then lenders will decline you as they can see you have shown no ability to pay that debt. Lenders have the ability to check your bank rating in seconds.</p>

        Compliance Item Fix - What Does A Low 5 Bank Rating Mean?
      </h2>
      <h3 class="text-md font-bold "> Bank Ratings Consist of Three Components</h3>
      <div class=" mb-2 bg-white">
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside  text-gray-800 text-base ">
            <li>The first component is your balance rating. This rating is your average minimum daily balance maintained in your account over the last three (3) month period. Maintaining at least $10,000 will rate as "Low 5", $5,000 rates as "Mid 4", $999 rates as "High 3", and so on.  You need to maintain a minimum "Low 5" bank rating ($10,000) for at least 3 months. Unfortunately, without at least a "low 5" rating, most lenders will assume your business has little ability to repay.</li>
            <li>The second component is the bank rating cycle which is three (3) months. You'll want to have at least a "low 5" for the three months prior to applying for larger loans. This is to show lenders that your business has the ability to debt service. How much money you have going through your account each month does not matter. What does matter is how much is available each day for the last 90 days to pay debt.</li>
            <li>
                The third and final component has to do with how you manage the account.  NSF (bounced) checks destroy bank ratings.  From this point forward, NSF checks are something you cannot allow.
            </li>
            
          </ol>
          <p class="text-gray-800 text-base mb-4">Check your business banking general ledger checking account statements for the last three months and look at your average daily bank account balance to be able to self-calculate what lenders are seeing as your current "Bank Rating".</p>

        <h2 class="text-sm font-semibold text-white bg-blue-600 p-2 rounded-t">
            In The Digital Age Every Lender Can See Your Business Banking Activity Via A Bank Verification
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-800 text-base mb-4">
            When you provide your business bank account routing and account number lenders and credit providers can do a "Bank Verification" where they can then see:</p>
            <ul class="list-decimal list-inside  text-gray-800 text-base pl-5">
                <li>A 36 month summary of deposits, average daily balances, and month ending balances</li>
                <li>Current balance status of the submitted bank routing and account numbers</li>
                <li>First date opened and last activity dates of the business bank account</li>
                <li>Bank ratings of that account and other accounts associated with the company</li>
                <li>Dates and amounts of all NSF returned debits and checks on the account</li>
                <li>Verification of all account signers including; Name, SSN, and Driverâ€™s License</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <p class="text-gray-800 text-base mb-4">The bottom line is that in today's digital age lenders and credit providers of all kinds can instantly access data on your business banking activity. This means they can see how much money has gone through your business bank account each day, month, year and how much of that money stuck to you.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-800 text-base mb-4">Your monthly revenue and your average daily bank balances have become an extremely critical part of your business getting approved for no personal guarantee loans and credit lines. It is also the single most important factor in your business showing it's ability to debt service.</p>
            <h3 class="text-md font-bold "> How To Get At Least A Low 5</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-800 text-base mb-4">If you don't have the $10,000 required for the low 5 rating, consider borrowing it from friends or family. Maybe pull it off personal credit cards or out of the equity in your home. If you borrow it from friends or family, explain to them you will not be "using" the money, but that it will just be sitting in your business checking account. Tell them you can return it to them in six (6) months. Maybe offer to pay interest. We will be looking at other creative ways to get the money you need.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-800 text-base mb-4">Don't Have $10,000? Don't Worry ... Bank ratings are totally separate from building business credit and in no way affect your ability to build strong scores. So if you don't have the $10,000, or can't get access to the $10,000 to secure a Low 5 Bank Rating, it will have no impact what-so-ever on your ability to build strong business credit scores. However, bank ratings can definitely have an impact on your ability to secure larger cash type business loans and credit lines in the future. So when your business starts making money remember to keep your daily balance above $10,000 in order to maintain at least a Low 5 Rating.</p>
