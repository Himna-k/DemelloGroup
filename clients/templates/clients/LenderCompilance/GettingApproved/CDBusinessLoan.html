        <h2 class="text-sm font-semibold text-white bg-blue-600 p-2 rounded-t">
            In The Digital Age Every Lender Can See Your Business Banking Activity Via A Bank Verification
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-800 text-base mb-4">
            When you provide your business bank account routing and account number lenders and credit providers can do a "Bank Verification" where they can then see:</p>
            <ul class="list-decimal list-inside  text-gray-800 text-base pl-5">
                <li>A 36 month summary of deposits, average daily balances, and month ending balances</li>
                <li>Current balance status of the submitted bank routing and account numbers</li>
                <li>First date opened and last activity dates of the business bank account</li>
                <li>Bank ratings of that account and other accounts associated with the company</li>
                <li>Dates and amounts of all NSF returned debits and checks on the account</li>
                <li>Verification of all account signers including; Name, SSN, and Driverâ€™s License</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <p class="text-gray-800 text-base mb-4">The bottom line is that in today's digital age lenders and credit providers of all kinds can instantly access data on your business banking activity. This means they can see how much money has gone through your business bank account each day, month, year and how much of that money stuck to you.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-800 text-base mb-4">Your monthly revenue and your average daily bank balances have become an extremely critical part of your business getting approved for no personal guarantee loans and credit lines. It is also the single most important factor in your business showing it's ability to debt service.</p>
            <h3 class="text-md font-bold "> How To Get At Least A Low 5</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-800 text-base mb-4">If you don't have the $10,000 required for the low 5 rating, consider borrowing it from friends or family. Maybe pull it off personal credit cards or out of the equity in your home. If you borrow it from friends or family, explain to them you will not be "using" the money, but that it will just be sitting in your business checking account. Tell them you can return it to them in six (6) months. Maybe offer to pay interest. We will be looking at other creative ways to get the money you need.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-800 text-base mb-4">Don't Have $10,000? Don't Worry ... Bank ratings are totally separate from building business credit and in no way affect your ability to build strong scores. So if you don't have the $10,000, or can't get access to the $10,000 to secure a Low 5 Bank Rating, it will have no impact what-so-ever on your ability to build strong business credit scores. However, bank ratings can definitely have an impact on your ability to secure larger cash type business loans and credit lines in the future. So when your business starts making money remember to keep your daily balance above $10,000 in order to maintain at least a Low 5 Rating.</p>
