    <p class="text-gray-800 text-base mb-4">Building strong business credit and getting approved for financing is all about paying attention to the details. It is very important that we have your exact business legal name. This includes the recorded DBA filing you will be using. It is not required to have a DBA, but if you need one (or already have one) there are potential issues to be aware of.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-800 text-base mb-4">Filing DBAs for your Corporation or LLC can cause multiple credit files to open if you're not careful. For example, say your business bank account is under "ABC Corporation" but you open a credit account as "ABC Corporation, dba ABC Tire Service", and you have another credit account that you opened as just "ABC Tire Service".
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-800 text-base mb-4">What will happen in the above example is that your business ends up with three open credit files under all three names...and now you have a mess. If you're going to use a DBA you'll need to avoid creating duplicate credit files. All banking, utilities, offices leases, credit accounts, etc. must be opened as "ABC Corporation dba ABC Tire Service".</p>

        Business Address and Location:
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-800 text-base mb-4">
        Past history has shown lenders that home based businesses default on their loans at a rate of 10 to 20 times higher than that of physical business location businesses. What this means is that if you put a residential address on any business loan or credit application then you will be immediately tagged as a much higher risk of default and therefore much more likely to be declined.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-800 text-base mb-4">
        The address of your business needs to look like a business address. Do not use a post office box. You can use your home address for business credit building, but be aware that some lenders will not fund "home based" businesses. This will not stop you from building business credit scores, but may limit your funding options.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-800 text-base mb-4">
            Our system is integrated with the USPS database. So the best way to know if the address you are using will work or not is to test it. Put the address in and click "save and continue". Then come back to this page. If the address shows "residential or mail stop" it is something you will need to fix. If the address comes back as "business or unknown", you are fine using that address for your business.

        Compliance Item Warning - Using Mail Stop Addresses May Get You Declined
      </h2>
      <div class="p-4 bg-white">
        <p class="text-sm text-black">
            A Mail Stop is your local post office or postal type store that will rent you a mailbox inside their store location. These type of addresses will show to lenders and credit providers that your business is not real and may be a very high risk of default. These are NOT virtual offices and are services such as: The UPS Store, Fedex Office, Postal Annex, Postnet, and any other local name that might offer the same type service,</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-black mt-4">
            Know that potential creditors will Google your stated business location and see these store fronts are obviously not your business location. When your business address is Google searched you want it to show as an office building, executive suite, or shared work space.</p>
